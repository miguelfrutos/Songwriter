# Project Motivation
Our Natural Language Processing professor, Angel Castellanos Gonzalez, has proposed us a challenge. Create an application that should address an actual use case scenario. Some people in our group play instruments and we have even tried to write songs, with unfortunate results, specially to our audience (family and friends) that were expecting a new Lady Gaga and Freddie Mercury in the room and after few songs realizing that maybe we should think of doing something else. Should we abandon our dreams?.

# Solution
A novel musician, real artists and the entire music industry are under pressure to generate higher output more quickly. Harnessing creativity and overcoming songwritersâ€™ blocks when writing lyrics and music pieces are challenging. Our solution is helping artists create song texts more efficiently.
